Need to add test module to each file


-- older



To remind you: Memio handles interaction with memory, ALU does the calculations and commands Mio to change values,
console is just the instruction broken into interpretable parts, and main is the loop that holds it together.



Then work on memory_io_interface to have commands work.  You could also try some dynamic memory or traits if can think of way.
Naturally I think the velow comment might be way.  Have it send to vector of registers and io devices, and have them implent
traits.
